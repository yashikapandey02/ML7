    "Ans: Underfitting is a situation arising when the hypothesis is way too simple, has poor generalizability, and when the machine\n",

    "2. Cross-validation by tenfold\n",

    "Ten-fold Cross-validation is a technique used to check the efficiency of machine learning models by subsetting data into 10 equal subsets. One subset is set aside for validation/testing and 9 subsets are used as training data. Cross validation is then done 10 times with each subset of the training data and tested against test data. Average of the all test scores is taken as the final test score for the model.\n",
    "3. Adjusting the parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Model hyper-parameters or simply parameters are values that have to be manually specified for best performance. Values for these parameters is found by emplying Brute Force techniques. At the chosen value, Cross validation error would be very low. As hyper-parameters increase, time and space complexity increases exponentially.\n",

    "Purity is an external metric for measuring performance of clusters. It can be defined as the number of data points that were classified correctly into clusters.\n",

    "Boosting is one of the ensemble machine learning modelling techniques in which, multiple base learners are trained in series over training data. Base learners are added to overcome the errors in previously added and trained base learners, until the entire training data has been correctly predicted. It reduces bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging is one of the ensemble machine learning modelling techniques in which, multiple base learners are trained in parallel over subsets of training data, sampled with replacement. All base learners produce a prediction and after a majority vote over the prediction, final value is output as the result. It reduces variance without impacting bias.\n",
    "iii. The eager learner vs. the lazy learner\n",
    "\n",
    "Eager learner algorithms are ones that generate a generalizable target function during the training phase. Unlike lazy learners where the computation over data is deferred until a new instance or query is input after which comparison between stored examples and query takes place, eager learners use the target function generated during training phase to generate the result for a new query. Example: Logistic Regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lazy learner or lazy learning algorithms, also called instance based learning algorithms are the ones which use stored instances seen during training phase of the model and then compare new instances with the stored instances to produce a result or prediction. These algorithms are called lazy learners because the actual operations or processing over data happens only when the trained model gets new instance for which a result has to be output. Example: K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm.\n"
